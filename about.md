## Hey there!

I build scalable distributed systems and create AI to master games. Passionate about reinforcement learning, performance optimization, and elegant solutions to complex problems.

## Background

My journey in software engineering has taken me through various domains:

- **Netflix (Current)**: Building distributed systems and backend services
- **Celestica**: Developed automation frameworks and testing infrastructure
- **Academic Research**: Explored reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems

I hold a degree in Computer Engineering, with a focus on machine learning and systems programming.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about two main areas:

**Building Scalable Systems**: There's something deeply satisfying about designing systems that handle massive scale while remaining maintainable and performant. At Netflix, I get to work on these challenges daily.

**AI & Reinforcement Learning**: In my personal time, I love creating AI agents that learn to play complex games. From board games like Terra Mystica to action games like SpeedRunners, I find the intersection of game theory and machine learning endlessly fascinating.

## Technical Interests

- **Languages**: Python, Rust, Java, TypeScript, Go
- **Systems**: Distributed systems, microservices architecture, performance optimization
- **AI/ML**: Reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, game AI
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring and observability

## Personal Projects

All my [personal projects](/projects) are playgrounds for experimenting with new technologies and exploring ideas in AI and game development.

Some highlights:

- **Terra Mystica RL**: A Rust-based reinforcement learning environment for the board game Terra Mystica
- **Splice**: A mobile app using AI to help plan group activities
- **HLRL**: A high-level reinforcement learning library for Python
- **SpeedRunners AI**: Deep RL agents that learned to play SpeedRunners

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- Playing board games (Terra Mystica is a favorite!)
- Exploring new ML papers and techniques
- Gaming and analyzing game mechanics
- Contributing to open source

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing:

- Reinforcement learning and AI
- Distributed systems architecture
- Game development and game AI
- Python/Rust/systems programming

Feel free to [reach out](/contact) if you want to chat about any of these topics, collaborate on open source, or just say hi!
