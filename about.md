## Hey there!

I’m a Senior Software Engineer at Netflix.

To get a TV show or movie from initial ideation all the way to being live on the service, there's a gargantuan amount of work involved. From securing contracts with talent, script writing, and getting the green light, to filming, post-production, localization, and marketing; there are dozens of domains involved that are large enough to have their own teams and organizations.

The one common thread connecting these distinct domains is the need to broadcast and react to new activity on the titles they are actively working on.

When a script is complete, we want to start localization as fast as possible. When footage has been shot and uploaded, we want to ensure creative workstations are ready for VFX artists. When the footage for a show has gone through post-production, we want to make sure that marketing is aware so that they can use the assets for marketing material.

This happens across multiple projects simultaneously, involving a massive flow of critical information required to streamline the creation of a show or movie.

**What I do is provide the infrastructure that underpins this communication, whether that be from system to system, system to person, or person to person.** I build the event bus that lets the rest of the business freely send and receive these signals at a scale of billions of events per day, allowing us to audit and react to how the business is evolving.

## Background

My journey in software engineering has taken me through various domains:

- **Netflix (Current)**: Building distributed systems and backend services
- **Celestica**: Developed automation frameworks and testing infrastructure
- **Academic Research**: Explored reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems

I hold a degree in Computer Engineering, with a focus on machine learning and systems programming.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about two main areas:

**Building Scalable Systems**: There's something deeply satisfying about designing systems that handle massive scale while remaining maintainable and performant. At Netflix, I get to work on these challenges daily.

**AI & Reinforcement Learning**: In my personal time, I love creating AI agents that learn to play complex games. From board games like Terra Mystica to action games like SpeedRunners, I find the intersection of game theory and machine learning endlessly fascinating.

## Technical Interests

- **Languages**: Python, Rust, Java, TypeScript, Go
- **Systems**: Distributed systems, microservices architecture, performance optimization
- **AI/ML**: Reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, game AI
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring and observability

## Personal Projects

All my [personal projects](/projects) are playgrounds for experimenting with new technologies and exploring ideas in AI and game development.

Some highlights:

- **Terra Mystica RL**: A Rust-based reinforcement learning environment for the board game Terra Mystica
- **Splice**: A mobile app using AI to help plan group activities
- **HLRL**: A high-level reinforcement learning library for Python
- **SpeedRunners AI**: Deep RL agents that learned to play SpeedRunners

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

- Playing board games (Terra Mystica is a favorite!)
- Exploring new ML papers and techniques
- Gaming and analyzing game mechanics
- Contributing to open source

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing:

- Reinforcement learning and AI
- Distributed systems architecture
- Game development and game AI
- Python/Rust/systems programming

Feel free to [reach out](/contact) if you want to chat about any of these topics, collaborate on open source, or just say hi!
