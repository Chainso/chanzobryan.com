    description: "A modular reinforcement learning system that trains agents to play SpeedRunners using direct game process injection. A C++ DLL hooks into the game to extract state and inject actions, exposing a Gymnasium-compatible environment via named pipes. Agents are trained using Rainbow IQN and RND in PyTorch, with a clean separation between game interfacing (sr-lib), environment wrapping (sr-gym), and agent training (sr-ai)."
