## Overview

Bill splitting is a solved problem, but it's rarely a seamless one. Most apps require manual entry, complex setup, or fighting with a clunky interface. Splice was built to change that. It's a high-performance, real-time mobile app that uses AI to turn the chaos of a group dinner into a structured, fair breakdown in seconds. By combining React Native with a powerful Supabase backend, Splice demonstrates how modern full-stack engineering can make everyday problems disappear.

## What is Splice?

Splice is a mobile expense tracker designed for groups. Whether you're living with roommates or traveling with friends, the app provides a single source of truth for who owes what.

The standout feature is the AI-powered receipt scanner. Instead of typing in every item from a long grocery bill, you simply take a photo. The app uses [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (OCR AI) to identify items, prices, and tax, then lets you assign them to people with a single tap. It handles the math so you don't have to.
